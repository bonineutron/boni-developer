Over these years I've had to use a wide variety of technologies, using React and Angular on the Frontend, and Node and Mysql on the Backend. In cloud services, I've used different tools from Aws and Firabase. Something I've discovered throughout developing applications is that I like to plan, because it allows me to foresee possible problems that may arise."
