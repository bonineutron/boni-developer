         "description": "Hi, I'm a software developer with 3 years of experience creating different types of platforms. Over these years I've had to use a wide variety of technologies, using React and Angular on the Frontend, and Node and Mysql on the Backend.\nIn cloud services, I've used different tools from Aws and Firabase. Something I've discovered throughout developing applications is that I like to plan, because it allows me to foresee possible problems that may arise."

On several occasions, while assisting in the development of this project, I enjoyed one of these audiovisual shorts.\nThe biggest challenge that arose for me was integrating the Stripe payment gateway, a task with significant responsibility that was successfully accomplished."

This challenge involved great responsibility, as quality was a non-negotiable requirement.\nEvery detail of the management system was carefully addressed, prioritizing an intuitive and user-friendly design while ensuring system stability. This was crucial due to the importance and sensitivity of the data being managed, which is fundamental to the company's operations."

         "description": "This development was accompanied by many challenges, it is one of the most complete administrators I have done.\nThe administrator required dynamic tables that all its actions had to communicate with the Backend, since the amount of information to be searched is too extensive, and that could have presented performance problems, which did not exist."
